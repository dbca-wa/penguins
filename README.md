[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to install and manage a virtual Python
environment. With Poetry installed, change into the project directory and run:

    poetry install

Activate the virtualenv like so:

    poetry shell

To run Python commands in the activated virtualenv, thereafter run them like so:

    python manage.py

Manage new or updating project dependencies with Poetry also, like so:

    poetry add newpackage==1.0

## Environment variables
